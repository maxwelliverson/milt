# Milt
Modular Integration Light Transport

A lightweight, extensible rendering engine aimed at providing an environment with which one can easily implement and test new algorithms. Focuses are on modularity and parametrization. Milt uses simple but powerful templates and interfaces to encourage compatibility; the driving idea is that any scene can be rendered with any algorithm, and any scene can be defined however you so choose.
